# SacHacks-2018
Hello, this is my team and our SacHacks 2018 Project. I am the team manager of the project.

The project consists of two parts.
1. The game part, where user can interact on their phone
2. The server part, where hosts can see the data coming in, sorting and who has won etc.

The project was written in C# on VisualStudio. When press start, the server sets up a socket and listen
to incoming signals from the users' phones.Then compile those data to a list of winner

I will upload the files of the game part as soon as I can

The scenes and scripts used in Unity are located in the Project file.
